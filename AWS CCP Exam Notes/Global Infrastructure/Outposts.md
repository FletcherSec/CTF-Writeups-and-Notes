- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
	- One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs)
	- One for their on-premises infrastructure
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs and tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
- AWS will setup and manage "Outpost Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
- You're now responsible for the outposts rack physical security

##### Benefits:
- Low-latency access to on premises systems
- Local data processing
- Data residency
- Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
- Fully managed service

Some services that work on Outposts:
- [[EC2]], [[EBS]], [[S3]], [[EKS]], [[ECS]], [[RDS]], [[EMR]]
