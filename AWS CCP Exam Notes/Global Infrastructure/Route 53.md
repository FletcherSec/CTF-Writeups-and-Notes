##### Routing Policies
- Need to know them at a high-level for the exam
- Simple Routing Policy
	- No health checks
- Weighted Routing Policy
	- Essentially load balancing from Route 53 to the IPs for intended instance load
- Latency Routing Policy
	- Finds distance of user from available servers and sends them the IP for the one which will provide them the lowest latency
- Failover Routing Policy
	- Health checks primary
	- Redirects to failover if health check fails
