- Single Region, Single AZ
	- Not High Availability
	- Bad Global Latency
	- Low difficulty setup
- Single Region, Multi AZ
	- High Availability
	- Bad Global Latency
	- Moderate Difficulty setup
- Multi Region, Active-Passive
	- Active EC2 in one region and passive in another
	- Active can read and write and replicates to passive
	- Passive can serve reads but not writes
	- better global reads but not writes
	- Increased difficulty setup
- Multi Region, Active-Active
	- Like Active-Passive but both Region instances are active
	- Both instances read and write\
	- Better read write latency
	- Harder setup
