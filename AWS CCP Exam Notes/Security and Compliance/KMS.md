- Anytime you hear "encryption" for an AWS service, it's most likely KMS
- KMS = AWS manages the encryption keys for us
- Encryption Opt-in
	- [[EBS]] volumes: encrypt volumes
	- [[S3]] buckets: Server-side encryption of objects (SSE-S3 enabled by default, SSE-KMS opt in)
	- [[Redshift]] database: encryption of data
	- [[RDS]] database: encryption of data
	- [[EFS]] drives: encryption of data
- Encryption Automatically enabled:
	- [[CloudTrail]] Logs
	- [[S3 Glacier Deep Archive]] (any s3 glacier)
	- [[Storage Gateway]]

##### Types of KMS Keys
- Customer Managed Key:
	- Create, manage, and used by the customer, can enable or disable
	- Possibility of rotation policy (new key generated every year, old key preserved)
	- Possibility to bring-your-own-key
- AWS Managed Key: Created, managed and used on the customer's behalf by AWS
	- Used by AWS services ([[S3]], [[EBS]], [[Redshift]])
- AWS Owned Key:
	- Collection of [[CMK]]s that an AWS service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts
	- AWS can use those to protect resources in your account (but you can't view the keys)
	- [[CloudHSM]] Keys (custom keystore):
		- Keys generated from your own [[CloudHSM]] hardware device
		- Cryptographic operations are performed within the [[CloudHSM]] cluster
