Example: building a serverless API
- Using [[Lambda]] to Create, Read, Update, Delete from a [[DynamoDB]]
- Want external clients to be able to access the [[Lambda]] function
- Expose the Lambda function via a [[API Gateway]] which interfaces with the client via a [[REST API]] and to the Lambda function via Proxy Requests

- Fully managed service for developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs
- Serverless and scalable
- Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs
- Support for security, user, authentication, API throttling, API keys, monitoring...

##### ==For exam: when you see something about making a **serverless API** think of API gateway and Lambda==
