- Elastic Kubernetes Service
- Allows you to launch managed [[Kubernetes]] clusters on AWS
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for management, deployment, and scaling of containerized apps (Docker)
- Containers can be hosted on:
	- [[EC2]] instances
	- [[Fargate]] (serverless)
- Kubernetes is cloud agnostic (can be used in any cloud - Azure, GCP...)
