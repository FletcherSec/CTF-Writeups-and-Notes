- Serverless is a new paradigm where the developers don't manage the servers anymore
- They just deploy functions!
- Initially Serverless == [[FaaS]] (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS [[Lambda]] but now also includes anything thats managed
- [[S3]], [[DynamoDB]], [[Fargate]], [[Lambda]] are all serverless
