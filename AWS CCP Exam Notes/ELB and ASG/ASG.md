##### Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Strategies
- [[Manual Scaling]]: Update the size of an ASG manually
- [[Dynamic Scaling]]: Respond to changing demand
	- [[Simple / Step Scaling]]
		- When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (CPU > 70%) add 2 units to ASG
		- When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (CPU < 30%) then remove 1 unit from ASG
	- [[Target Tracking Scaling]]
		- Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
	- [[Scheduled Scaling]]:
		- Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
		- Example: Increase the minimum capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays
	- [[Predictive Scaling]]
		- Uses machine learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
		- Automatically provision the right number of [[EC2]] instances in advance
		- Useful when your load has predictable time-based patterns, powered by ML
