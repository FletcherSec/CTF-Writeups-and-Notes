- High Availability vs Scalability (vertical and horizontal) vs Elasticity vs Agility in the Cloud
- [[ELB]]
	- Distribute traffic across backend [[EC2]] instances, can be multi-AZ
	- Supports health checks
	- 4 Types: Classic (old), Application (HTTP - L7), Network (TCP - L4), Gateway (L3)
- [[ASG]]
	- Implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
	- Scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy
	- Integrated with ELB
