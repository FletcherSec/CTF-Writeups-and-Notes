- For the exam: Kinesis = real-time big data streaming
- Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale

	- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
	- Amazon Data Firehose: load Kinesis Data Streams into [[S3]], [[Redshift]], [[OpenSearch]], etc...
