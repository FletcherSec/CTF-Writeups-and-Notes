- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
- There are two patterns of application communication
	- Synchronous communications (application to application)
	- Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)
- Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
	- What if you suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually its 10?
	- In this case its better to decouple your applications:
		- Using [[SQS]]: queue model
		- Using [[SNS]]: pub/sub model
		- Using [[Kinesis]]: real-time data streaming model
	- These services can scale independently from our application
