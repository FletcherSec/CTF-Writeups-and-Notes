- Scalability: vertical and horizontal
- Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable and easily configured
- Automation: [[Serverless]], [[IaaS]], [[ASG]]
- Loose Coupling:
	- Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
	- Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
	- A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
- Services, not Servers:
	- Don't just use [[EC2]]
	- Use managed services, databases, [[Serverless]], etc.

Not something you want to balance or tradeoff but rather a synergy
