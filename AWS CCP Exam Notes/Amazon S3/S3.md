- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions and all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
	- No uppercase, No underscore
	- 3-63 characters long
	- Not an ip
	- Must start with lowercase letter or number
	- Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
	- Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

##### Objects
- Objects (files) have a Key
- the key is the FULL path
	- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
- key is composed of a prefix + object name
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (though the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Object values are the content of the body
	- Max object size is 5TB
	- If exceeding 5 TB, use "multi-part" upload
- Objects have metadata:
	- List of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata
	- Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
	- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
