# AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam Notes

The AWS Cloud Practitioner exam features countless acronyms. This vault allows you to easily reference acronym meanings and context by hovering over (with Ctrl) or clicking on the hyperlink, then using the back arrow when you're refreshed.

## Study Tip
For general studying and navigation, I recommend going through the summaries of each section and navigating definitions from there, as the most exam-applicable material is covered in the summaries.
