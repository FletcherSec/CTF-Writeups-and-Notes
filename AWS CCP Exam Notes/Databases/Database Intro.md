- Storing data on disk ([[EFS]], [[EBS]], [[EC2 Instance Store]], [[S3]]) can have its limits
- sometimes you want to store data in a database
- You can structure the data
- You build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data
- You can define relationships between your datasets
- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes, and constraints
- 
[[Relational Databases]]:
- Looks like Excel spreadsheets with links between them
- Can use SQL language to perform queries / lookups
[[NoSQL Database]]:
- NoSQL = non-SQL = non-relational databases
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
- Benefits:
	- Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
	- Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
	- High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
	- Highly functional: types optimized for the data model
- Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases
- Typically utilize JSON (javascript object notation)
