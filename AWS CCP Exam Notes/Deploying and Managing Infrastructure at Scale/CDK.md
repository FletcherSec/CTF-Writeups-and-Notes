- AWS Cloud Development Kit
- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
	- Javascript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
- The code is "compiled" into a [[CloudFormation]] template (JSON/YAML)
- You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
	- Great for [[Lambda]] functions
	- Great for [[Docker]] containers in [[ECS]] / [[EKS]]
