##### The 7 Rs
- Retire
	- Turn off things you dont need
	- Helps with reducing surface areas for attacks (more security)
	- Save cost, maybe 10-20%
	- Focus your attention on resources that must be maintained
- Retain
	- Do nothing for now (still a decision to make in Cloud Migration)
	- Security, data compliance, performance, unresolved dependencies
	- No business value to migrate, mainframe or midrange and non-x86 unix apps
- Relocate
	- Move apps from on-premises to its Cloud version
	- Move [[EC2]] instances to a different [[VPC]], AWS account or AWS Region
	- Example: transfer servers from VMware Software-defined Data Center ([[SSDC]]) to VMware Cloud on AWS
- Rehost "lift and shift"
	- Simple migrations by re-hosting on AWS (applications, databases, data...)
	- Migrate machines (physical, virtual, another Cloud) to AWS Cloud
	- No cloud optimizations being done, applications is migrates are migrated as is
	- Could save up to 30% on cost
	- Example: Migrate using AWS Application Migration Service
- Replatform "lift and reshape"
	- Ex: migrate your database to [[RDS]], migrate your app to [[Beanstalk]]
	- Not changing core architecture, but leverage some Cloud optimizations
	- Save time and money by moving to a fully managed service or [[Serverless]]
- Repurchase "drop and shop"
	- Moving to a different product while moving to the Cloud
	- Often you move to a [[SaaS]] platform
	- Expensive in short-term but quick to deploy
	- Example: CRM to Salesforce.com, HR to Workday, CMS to Drupal
- Refactor / re-architect
	- Re-imagining how the application is architected using Cloud Native features
	- Driven by the need of the business to add features and improve scalability, performance, security, and agility
	- Move from a monolithic application to micro-services
