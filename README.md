# CTF-Writeups-and-Notes

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups repository!

Each directory in this repo is an **Obsidian vault**, designed for viewing within the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app. These vaults include my notes, solutions, and insights from various CTF challenges.

## üóÇÔ∏è How to View Properly

To get the full experience, please open these directories using **Obsidian**. Here's how:

### üîß Getting Started with Obsidian

1. **Download Obsidian**  
   Visit [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install and Launch**  
   Follow the installation instructions. Once installed, open the Obsidian application.

3. **Open a Vault**  
   - Click on **"Open folder as vault"** from the launch screen.
   - Navigate to one of the directories in this repository that you cloned locally.
   - Select the folder and open it.
